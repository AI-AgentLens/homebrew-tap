  # Structured steps, not Ruby flight blocks: Homebrew 7.0.0 deprecated
  # preflight/postflight (Homebrew/brew#23729) and the next minor release turns
  # that into an error. These steps need Homebrew >= 6.0.16; older ones refuse
  # to load the cask. They run in Homebrew's sandbox with a throwaway HOME, so
  # home paths use base: :home (a literal ~ would name the throwaway HOME), and
  # the uid comes from id -u because a steps block allows no Ruby interpolation.
  # must_succeed: false keeps system_command's ignore-failure behaviour.

  # brew uninstall --zap removes the agent hooks that agentshield setup wrote
  # (#4491). Zap only, never uninstall: Homebrew runs uninstall stanzas and
  # uninstall flight blocks on every upgrade and reinstall (Cask::Installer
  # start_upgrade -> uninstall_artifacts), so removing hooks there would strip
  # protection on each brew upgrade. Zap runs only on brew uninstall --zap,
  # before the binary link and the Caskroom are removed, so the staged binary
  # still runs. Each agent is non-fatal: a managed host refuses --disable and
  # keeps its hooks, which belong to the MDM. ~/.agentshield is kept on
  # purpose: it holds the audit log, which is evidence.

  caveats <<~EOS
    Two tools installed:
      agentshield      — Runtime security gateway for AI agents
      agentcompliance  — Local compliance scanner (semgrep-based)

    Quick start:
      agentshield setup
      agentshield login

    To uninstall and remove the agent hooks setup wrote:
      brew uninstall --zap --cask agentshield
    A plain brew uninstall leaves the hooks. ~/.agentshield (audit log) is kept.
